Dont Starve Together Lily Character Mod (version 0.9)

Unzip file in:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Don't Starve Together\mods

Because its not on steam workshop, all parties must install it if you plan to play with others.

Lily is designed to be a hybrid between Wolfgang and Webber. Food is going to be your biggest concern. She can eat monster meat which can give you more options. When playing with friends it is recommended you focus on hunting with her, while other players focus on support/gathering. Lily makes for a very reliable fighter and will be the go-to for hound attacks and bosses. Her slight speed buff is mostly for hunting koalaphants more easily, however it can help with kiting.

Stats:
200 health, 100 sanity, 300 hunger

Perks:
- +40% damage, +5% speed, +75% hunger
- can eat monster meat
- friend of spiders; enemy of pigs

*known issues*
- Name plate on character select is not working properly
- wearing armor looks funny on her. I recommend getting a More Equip Slots mod and wear a backpack over your armor.
- faces/emotes are unfinished
- some jank with some leg animations
- her dialogue is *mostly* unedited from Webber

Changelog:
- Lily's torso and legs are a lot bigger
- Arms and hands are refined
- Adjusted her perks
- *some* dialogue changes. (there is too much to edit good lord)
